# generator-atomic

> This [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator scaffolds an atomic-design templating framework based on the markup language [Jade](http://http://jade-lang.com/).
> It comes bundled with [BabelJS](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6 support, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), ESLint and a build-in Livereload Server. 
> Several Subgenerators (atom, molecule, organism...) help you during your project to quickly add new modules and link them properly.
> [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) helps you to automate your workflow with several helpful tasks like "build", "release" and "serve" (default)

### Module Directory Layout
Each Module (atom, molecule, organism...) has this Directory Layout:
```
|   |   ├── index.jade                  # Module Overview Page
|   |   └── □ breadcrumb                  
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.jade         # Demo: showcase the Module in all available versions
|   |       ├── _breadcrumb.jade        # Markup: Jade Mixins (with _underscore)
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.js           # Script: ES2015 through BabelJS (not in atoms, templates and pages)
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.less         # Styles: LESS precompiler
|   |       └── breadcrumb.spec         # Test: Galen Specfile for Layout Tests
