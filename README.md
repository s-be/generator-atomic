This [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator scaffolds an atomic-design templating framework based on the markup language [Jade](http://http://jade-lang.com/).
It comes bundled with [BabelJS](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6 support, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org/) or [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), ESLint and a build-in Livereload Server. 
Several Subgenerators (atom, molecule, organism...) help you during your project to quickly add new modules and link them properly.
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) helps you to automate your workflow with several helpful tasks like "build", "release" and "serve" (default). For automated Layout-testing you can use the [Galen Framework](http://galenframework.com/).


## Installation

### Install Yeoman

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Install generator-atomic

To install generator-atomic from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-atomic
```

## Usage

Initiate the generator in your project folder:

```bash
yo atomic
```

To generate modules use following commands in your project folder:

```bash
yo atomic:atom
```

```bash
yo atomic:molecule
```

```bash
yo atomic:organism
```

```bash
yo atomic:template
```

```bash
yo atomic:page
```

## Grunt Workflow

### `grunt default`
Runs [`grunt serve`](#grunt-serve).

### `grunt serve`
Start a development server that watches files and livereloads on changes.
Subtarget: `grunt serve:dist`: Serve a production Build.

### `grunt build`
Build the (optimized for production) code into `/dist`.

### `grunt test`
Build, Serve and run Layout-Tests with Galen.

### `grunt release`
Create a Release of the Project (bump and tag).

|Tasks| Description
|---------|-------
| `grunt release:patch` | Create a patch release of the Project.
| `grunt release:minor` | Create a minor release of the Project.
| `grunt release:mayor` | Create a mayor release of the Project.

### Directory Layout
```

```

### Module Directory Layout
Each Module (atom, molecule, organism...) has this Directory Layout:
```
|   |   ├── index.jade                  # Module Overview Page
|   |   └── □ breadcrumb                  
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.jade         # Demo: showcase the Module in all available versions
|   |       ├── _breadcrumb.jade        # Markup: Jade Mixins (with _underscore)
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.js           # Script: ES2015 through BabelJS (not in atoms, templates and pages)
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.unit.js      # Unit-Test: Karma/Jasmine Unit Test
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.scss         # Styles: LESS precompiler
|   |       ├── breadcrumb.spec         # Test: Galen Specfile for Layout Tests
|   |       └── breadcrumb.yaml         # Content Model for this module
```
